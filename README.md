ToucanTech Test
----------------------------------------------------
Test detail
_________________
The ToucanTech database stores information about its members. Each member can be associated with 1 or more school.

You should build a demo that allows someone to add a new member with the fields “Name”, “Email Address” and "School" (selected from a list). The demo should display all members for a selected school.   

You may use any freely available programming language and modules (although be aware that the primary language we use is PHP). We will want to run and connect to your code on our own machines so if there are any unusual pre-requisites please document them.

Please treat this as a serious piece of code and apply best practices. This code is being written for others to scrutinise - if you are selected for interview you will be asked about it. 

We’ll be assessing your programme and database design. Code re-use, extensibility and maintenance are all important.

One thing we look for is  an understating of relational databases - so would expect to see in a test like this for example separate tables for members, schools and a link table to connect the other tables rather than just a school name text field added onto the members table.
